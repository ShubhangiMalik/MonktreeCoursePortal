About the Course:
Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for 
a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. 
This course will cover various aspects of Frontend web development.

Section 1:
TOPIC : HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms 
may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

Section 2: 
TOPIC : CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a 
markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, 
provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant 
CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css 
file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Section 3:
TOPIC : Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout 
to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. 
Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, 
tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize 
the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.
